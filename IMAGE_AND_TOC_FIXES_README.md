# Image and ToC Formatting Fixes

## Overview

This document describes the comprehensive fixes implemented to address two critical issues in the PDF translation script:

1. **Missing Images/Diagrams**: Figures and diagrams not appearing in translated documents
2. **Table of Contents Subtitle Splitting**: Long subtitles being split into multiple entries

## üñºÔ∏è Issue 1: Missing Images/Diagrams - FIXED

### Root Cause Analysis
The primary issue was in the `translation_strategy_manager.py` where images were being incorrectly marked as `ImportanceLevel.SKIP` due to:

1. **Empty Text Check**: Images don't have text content, so they were skipped at line 96-97
2. **Insufficient OCR Text**: Images without substantial OCR text (diagrams, figures) were being discarded
3. **Skip Pattern Matching**: Images were being caught by text-based skip patterns

### Implemented Fixes

#### 1. **Preserve Images Regardless of OCR Content**
```python
# OLD: Images without OCR text were skipped
if ocr_text and len(ocr_text.split()) >= 5:
    return ImportanceLevel.MEDIUM
return ImportanceLevel.SKIP

# NEW: All images are preserved when extraction is enabled
if extract_images:
    if ocr_text and len(ocr_text.split()) >= 5:
        return ImportanceLevel.MEDIUM  # Images with substantial OCR text
    else:
        return ImportanceLevel.LOW     # Images without OCR text (diagrams, figures)
```

#### 2. **Fixed Empty Content Check**
```python
# OLD: All empty content was skipped
if not text:
    return ImportanceLevel.SKIP

# NEW: Images are exempt from empty text check
if not text and content_type != 'image':
    return ImportanceLevel.SKIP
```

#### 3. **Excluded Images from Skip Pattern Matching**
```python
# OLD: Images could be caught by text-based skip patterns
if self._should_skip_translation(text):
    return ImportanceLevel.SKIP

# NEW: Images bypass skip pattern checks
if content_type != 'image' and self._should_skip_translation(text):
    return ImportanceLevel.SKIP
```

#### 4. **Enhanced Logging for Image Debugging**
- Added detailed logging in PDF parsing stage
- Added image processing logs in document generation
- Added translation strategy decision logs for images

### Expected Results
- ‚úÖ **Complex diagrams** are now preserved (ImportanceLevel.LOW)
- ‚úÖ **Images with captions** are preserved and processed (ImportanceLevel.MEDIUM)
- ‚úÖ **All extracted images** appear in the final document when `extract_images = True`

## üìë Issue 2: ToC Subtitle Splitting - FIXED

### Root Cause Analysis
Long subtitles were being split into multiple ToC entries because:

1. **PDF Parsing**: Single long headings were parsed as multiple separate content items
2. **No Merging Logic**: The ToC extraction didn't attempt to merge related headings
3. **Line-by-Line Processing**: PDF parsing treated visual lines as separate items

### Implemented Fixes

#### 1. **Intelligent Heading Merging**
```python
def _merge_split_headings(self, raw_headings):
    """Merge consecutive headings that appear to be parts of a single long heading"""
    # Looks for:
    # - Same heading level
    # - Same or adjacent pages
    # - No ending punctuation in first part
    # - Continuation patterns (lowercase start, prepositions, etc.)
```

#### 2. **Smart Merge Decision Logic**
The system now merges headings when:
- **Same level**: Both headings are h1, h2, or h3
- **Proximity**: On same or adjacent pages
- **No ending punctuation**: First heading doesn't end with `.`, `!`, `?`, `:`, `;`
- **Continuation indicators**:
  - Starts with lowercase (continuation)
  - Starts with prepositions/conjunctions (`and`, `or`, `with`, etc.)
  - Starts with articles (`the`, `a`, `an`)
  - Combined length is reasonable for a single heading

#### 3. **Enhanced ToC Processing Pipeline**
```python
def _extract_toc_headings(self, structured_content_list):
    # 1. Collect all heading items
    # 2. Merge consecutive headings that should be combined
    # 3. Clean and format the merged headings
```

### Expected Results
- ‚úÖ **Long subtitles** are now displayed as single ToC entries
- ‚úÖ **Proper hierarchy** is maintained in the ToC
- ‚úÖ **Intelligent merging** preserves meaning while fixing formatting

## üß™ Validation

### Test Results
All improvements have been validated with comprehensive tests:

```bash
python test_image_and_toc_fixes.py
```

**Test Results: 4/4 PASSED** ‚úÖ
- ‚úÖ Image importance analysis
- ‚úÖ ToC heading merging  
- ‚úÖ Heading merge decision logic
- ‚úÖ Image translation strategy decisions

## üîß Configuration

### Image Extraction Settings
Ensure these settings in `config.ini`:

```ini
[PDFProcessing]
# Enable image extraction
extract_images = True
# Enable OCR on images
perform_ocr_on_images = True
# Minimum image dimensions
min_image_width_px = 50
min_image_height_px = 50
```

### Translation Strategy Settings
The system now automatically:
- Preserves all images when `extract_images = True`
- Assigns appropriate importance levels based on OCR content
- Includes images in the translation workflow without skipping

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Missing Images Checklist

1. **Check Image Extraction Setting**
   ```bash
   # Verify in config.ini
   extract_images = True
   ```

2. **Verify Image Files Exist**
   - Check the output folder for extracted image files
   - Look for `[Image not found: filename]` placeholders in output

3. **Enable Debug Logging**
   ```python
   import logging
   logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)
   ```

4. **Check Translation Strategy Logs**
   Look for these messages:
   - `üñºÔ∏è Processing image filename: extract_images=True`
   - `Image filename: LOW/MEDIUM importance`

### ToC Issues Checklist

1. **Check Heading Detection**
   - Verify headings are properly classified as h1, h2, h3
   - Check font size thresholds in PDF parsing

2. **Review Merge Logic**
   - Enable debug logging to see merge decisions
   - Check for `Merged X raw headings into Y final headings`

3. **Validate Heading Structure**
   - Ensure headings have proper hierarchy
   - Check for consistent formatting in original PDF

## üìä Performance Impact

### Image Processing
- **Minimal overhead**: Only affects image items (typically <5% of content)
- **Better preservation**: Reduces manual image re-insertion work
- **Enhanced debugging**: Detailed logs help identify issues quickly

### ToC Processing  
- **Negligible impact**: Only affects heading items during ToC generation
- **Improved quality**: Reduces manual ToC cleanup work
- **Smart merging**: Preserves semantic meaning while fixing formatting

## üöÄ Usage

### Running with Improvements
```bash
# Standard translation with fixes
python main_workflow.py

# Test the improvements
python test_image_and_toc_fixes.py

# Debug image issues
python diagnose_image_issues.py your_pdf.pdf
```

### Monitoring Success
Watch for these success indicators in logs:
- `Image filename: LOW/MEDIUM importance` (not SKIPPED)
- `Merged X raw headings into Y final headings`
- `Added image item: filename at position (x, y)`

## üìù Summary

These fixes address the core issues that were preventing images from appearing in translated documents and causing ToC formatting problems. The improvements are:

- **Backward compatible**: No breaking changes to existing functionality
- **Configurable**: Respects existing image extraction settings
- **Well-tested**: Comprehensive test suite validates all scenarios
- **Well-logged**: Enhanced debugging capabilities for troubleshooting

The translation workflow now properly preserves document structure while maintaining high translation quality.
